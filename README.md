# PAD-Sepsis
**Peripheral arterial disease prevalence among sepsis hospitalizations and associated outcomes**

Research Plan, two Stata do files, and six Stata log files included. 

One do file defines the variables of interest in this epidemiological study. The second completes our main and sensitivity analyses.

Five log files, for each NIS year included, identify sepsis hospitalizations. The "Table 1" log file defines the cohort by cardiovascular disease categories and the "Cox Regression" log file consists of our main and sensitivity analyses.
